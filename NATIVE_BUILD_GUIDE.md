# Native Build Guide - Development Client

## What Changed

I've configured your app to use **Expo Development Client** (native builds) instead of Expo Go.

## Why Native Builds?

Development Client gives you:
- ✅ Custom native modules support
- ✅ Full control over native code
- ✅ Better debugging for native issues
- ❌ Slower builds (requires Xcode compilation)
- ❌ Must rebuild when changing native dependencies

## How to Build and Run

### First Time Setup (or after changing native code):

```bash
npm run prebuild
npm run build:ios
```

This will:
1. Generate `ios/` and `android/` folders with proper expo-dev-client configuration
2. Install CocoaPods dependencies
3. Build the native app with Xcode
4. Install it on the simulator
5. Start the dev server

**Note:** The build takes 2-5 minutes the first time.

### Daily Development (JavaScript changes only):

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Then press 'i' to open the simulator. The app is already built, so it launches instantly.

### After Adding Native Dependencies:

If you add a new native module (like a camera library, etc.):

```bash
npm run clean:native
npm run prebuild
npm run build:ios
```

## Available Scripts

| Script | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run prebuild` | Generate native folders with current config |
| `npm run build:ios` | Build and install iOS app (takes 2-5 min) |
| `npm run start:dev` | Start dev server for already-built app |
| `npm run ios` | Full rebuild + start (use for first time) |
| `npm run clean:native` | Remove ios/android/.expo folders |
| `npm run clean` | Nuclear clean (removes node_modules too) |

## Quick Reference

```bash
# First time or after changes to app.json/native code:
npm run ios

# Daily development (just JavaScript changes):
npm run start:dev
# Press 'i'

# Something broken? Full clean rebuild:
npm run clean:native
npm run prebuild
npm run build:ios
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

```bash
# Clean and try again
npm run clean:native
npm run prebuild
npm run build:ios
```

### "No bundle URL present"

The dev server isn't running. Start it:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### Simulator Won't Open

```bash
./reset-simulator.sh
npm run build:ios
```

### Want to Go Back to Expo Go?

1. Remove `"expo-dev-client"` from `plugins` in app.json
2. Run: `npm run clean:native`
3. Run: `npm start` (and press 'i')

## What Files Were Created

- **ios/** - Native iOS project (generated, in .gitignore)
- **android/** - Native Android project (generated, in .gitignore)

These folders are auto-generated by `prebuild` and should not be manually edited unless you know what you're doing.

## Important Notes

- The `ios/` and `android/` folders are in `.gitignore`
- Running `prebuild` will regenerate them from your app.json config
- The dev client app shows a different splash screen than Expo Go
- You can still use Expo Go for quick testing by running `npm start`
